              <p> When your reservation is made, at the reserved time, bring your car to the designated spot on each company where MyDetailer.com will be located. When the car service is complete, MyDetailer.com will contact you to let you know your car is ready. If there is a specific time that you would like the service done or to pick up the car after the service is complete, you can indicate that in the Comments field on the online reservation. Employees usually drop off before they arrive and pick up after theyâ€™re gone.  If employee arrives at work before time that MyDetailer.com arrives , the employee needs to leave the keys at the front desk for MyDetailer.com to pick up. Please make sure to notify MyDetailer.com your specific vehicle information with a License number.</p>
              <p> If they pay in advance we can drop off the key at the front desk and they can pick up their car later.  </p>
              <p> While reservations are recommended, you can drop-in and request a service. However, depending on the amount of reservations, it may not be possible to squeeze you in. </p>
